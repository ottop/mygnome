# My Gnome Setup
**Work in progress**

My gnome configuration documented.

In this repository, I have a collection of folders with markdown files explaining how I made my gnome work as it does. Gnome is bad with dotfiles, so this is my approach. I document everything that I have changed, so I don't explicitly mention stuff that is obviously in a default state.

This is currently based on gnome 44. 

Index:

# My Gnome Setup

My gnome configuration documented.

In this repository, I have a collection of folders with markdown files explaining how I made my gnome work as it does. Gnome is bad with dotfiles, so this is my approach. I document everything that I have changed, so I don't explicitly mention stuff that is obviously in a default state. There is also a direct file for getting my full config, but that will need modifying to work for you. 

This is currently based on gnome 44. 

There are 2 folders
* Desktop - Configuration on my desktop
* Laptop - Configuration on my laptop (currently empty)

Index:
1. Stock settings and desktop config
2. Gnome tweaks
3. Extensions
